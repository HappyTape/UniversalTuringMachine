# UniversalTuringMachine

A universal turing machine I had to program in school back in 2021.

The transitions for the addition and multiplication and their binary encoding are shown in the file  [TMAdditionMultiplikation.pdf](https://github.com/HappyTape/UniversalTuringMachine/blob/main/TMAdditionMultiplikation.pdf)
There's a Step-Mode included which stops after every calculation step.
